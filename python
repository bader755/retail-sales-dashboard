In the Python stage of the project, we conducted data analysis and visualization using the powerful libraries Pandas and Matplotlib. 
We began by importing and cleaning the dataset using Pandas, ensuring all columns were properly formatted for analysis, especially the sale_date column which we converted into datetime format.
From there, we extracted the month names to identify seasonal trends. We performed grouping operations using groupby() to aggregate total sales by month, giving us a clear view of how revenue fluctuated throughout the year.
We then visualized the results using Matplotlib, creating a bar chart that displayed monthly sales performance in a visually compelling way.
The chart helped reveal sales peaks and low-performing months, providing valuable business insight. 
Additionally, we identified potential outliers and variations in sales using descriptive statistics.
This step was crucial for transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights, making Python a key tool in the analytical pipeline of the project.
