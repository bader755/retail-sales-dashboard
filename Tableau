In the Tableau phase of the project, we transformed our cleaned sales data into interactive and insightful dashboards. We started by importing the dataset into Tableau and building multiple sheets to highlight different aspects of the sales performance. In Sheet 1, we visualized total sales by product category, with colors representing different months, labels showing regional distribution, and a product-level filter for deeper exploration. Sheet 2 provided a view of total sales by month using a bar chart, helping identify seasonal trends, with filters and color encoding for quantity and region. Sheet 3 focused on product-level sales performance, using quantity sold as the metric, categorized by region and unit price. Each sheet was carefully designed to reveal unique insights. We then brought everything together in a well-organized dashboard, where we renamed sheets for clarity and applied consistent filters and interactivity. The final dashboard presents a complete picture of sales behavior, regional differences, and category performance, allowing stakeholders to explore and understand the data dynamically and effectively.
